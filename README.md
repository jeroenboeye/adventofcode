# Advent of code

My solutions to advent of code + some helper functions.

Repo structure and file templates inspired by [Anthony Sottile](https://github.com/anthonywritescode/aoc2021).

`aocd` is used to import data from the command line and submit solutions from within Python.
Documentation on how to set this up can be found [here](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data#quickstart)
